# Solid Lite Improvement Proposals (SLIPs)

## Introduction

Solid Lite Improvement Proposals (SLIPs) are the core mechanism for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and documenting the design decisions that have gone into Solid Lite. Similar to other successful open source extenssions (PIPs, NIPs, FEPs etc.), SLIPs are the primary record for Solid Lite enhancements, providing transparency and a well-defined process for the evolution of the platform.

## Concept

SLIPs are a common-knowledge set of proposals, each designed to evolve the Solid Lite network responsibly. They encourage participation and discussion, ensuring that all voices can contribute to the future direction of Solid Lite. Each SLIP goes through a rigorous process of discussion, vetting, and consensus-building within the community.

SLIPs are categorized into three numerical ranges, each representing a different scope of influence:

1. **Core SLIPs (1-1000):** These proposals affect the core protocol of Solid Lite, including consensus mechanisms, block structure, network protocols, and cryptographic algorithms. Core SLIPs require a high degree of technical knowledge and understanding of the underlying infrastructure of Solid Lite.

2. **Related Project SLIPs (1001-10,000):** Proposals in this range apply to software projects that are intimately related to the Solid Lite core protocol. This may include official wallet interfaces, explorer APIs, or other projects that, while not part of the core protocol, are essential to the Solid Lite ecosystem.

3. **Miscellaneous SLIPs (10,001-100,000):** This broad category is for all other proposals, including community and social governance, educational resources, and collaborations with external projects. These SLIPs can range from minor tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to new feature suggestions for applications built on Solid Lite.

## Submission Process

The SLIP process begins with a new idea or a concept. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the steps an SLIP goes through:

1. **Pre-proposal Discussion:** This informal stage is for bouncing ideas around within the community. It can be done through community forums, GitHub discussions, or other channels.

2. **Draft Proposal:** The author formalizes the idea into a draft SLIP, following a template that includes a clear specification, rationale, technical documentation, and any other necessary details.

3. **Proposal Review:** The draft is submitted as a pull request to the SLIP repository, where it is assigned a provisional number and reviewed by the community.

4. **Community Consensus:** Through discussion and feedback, the proposal is refined. Core SLIPs often require a longer period of scrutiny due to their impact on the network.

5. **Finalization:** Once a consensus is reached, and any required changes are made, the SLIP is either accepted, deferred, or rejected by the SLIP editors.

6. **Implementation:** For an accepted SLIP, the next step is implementation within the Solid Lite codebase. A successful implementation is followed by integration into the main network.

## Participation

The SLIP process is open to anyone. Participation from the community is not only encouraged but is a critical aspect of the governance and evolution of Solid Lite. Whether you are a developer, a researcher, or simply an enthusiast, your contributions can help shape the future of [Solid Lite](https://github.com/solid-lite).

## Conclusion

SLIPs embody the spirit of open-source development and decentralized decision-making. By setting a clear path for proposals, SLIPs ensure that the Solid Lite network continues to grow and adapt in a way that serves its users best, maintaining transparency, democracy, and innovation at its core.
