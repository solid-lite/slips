# SLIP-80

Null Auth System for Testing Servers
------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:melvincarvalho`

This SLIP defines the Null Auth system, a highly accessible authentication mechanism for testing purposes. This system is designed to facilitate a quick start for implementers, allowing both read and write operations without any authentication barriers:

- The Null Auth system MUST allow unauthenticated read access to all server resources.
- The Null Auth system MUST allow unauthenticated write access to all server resources.
- Implementers MUST ensure that the Null Auth system is **NOT** used in production environments due to its lack of security features.

### Implementation Notes

1. Server setup with Null Auth should be straightforward, requiring minimal configuration. Typically, this involves disabling the usual authentication checks and allowing requests to proceed without credentials.

2. While using Null Auth, servers will not differentiate between users. Every request is treated as though it is authorized, so no user-specific data handling will be in place.

3. It is highly recommended that servers running with Null Auth are isolated from public networks to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or services.

4. Implementers are encouraged to set clear environment distinctions to ensure that Null Auth is not accidentally enabled in a production setting.

5. Null Auth is useful for automated testing, where scripts need to interact with the server API without the overhead of authentication procedures.

### Warning

The Null Auth system is inherently insecure and provides no protection for the data or services exposed. It should only be used in controlled environments where security is not a concern, and there is no risk of exposure to unauthorized users.

Under no circumstances should Null Auth be deployed on servers that are accessible via the Internet or other insecure networks.

### Conclusion

Null Auth is a utility designed to ease the development and testing phase for Solid Lite implementers. By eliminating the complexity of authentication, it allows for rapid deployment and testing of server functionalities. However, its use must be strictly limited to appropriate test environments to maintain security and integrity of the Solid Lite network.
